<br />
A software engineer at Save Your Wardrobe, I'm a full-stack development ninja with a particular talent for wrangling backend systems. I am passionate about machine learning and love sharing my knowledge by teaching Python at Gomycode. And let's not forget ‚Äì My team and I won Google's prize at Orange Summer Challenge 2022 (no big deal, just saying) after interning for 4 months at Orange Tunisia.

I believe in going the extra mile ‚Äì not just because it's the right thing to do, but also because it's where the magic happens. As a creative problem solver, I'm never satisfied with the status quo. I'm always looking for ways to push the envelope, find new solutions to old problems, and make the world a better place ‚Äì one line of code at a time.

And when I'm not saving the world (or at least trying to), you can find me indulging my passion for all things automotive. I'm a huge Formula One fan and love watching races whenever possible. And speaking of movement ‚Äì did I mention that I am also a salsa dancer? Yes, I am a salsa-dancing software engineer. I love the challenge of learning new styles and techniques, and I'm always up for a good dance-off (or code-off, for that matter).

I ‚ù§Ô∏è Open Source, learning new things, and listening to other people!
