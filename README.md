I love to dig into people's problems and solve them with tech! I spend my time, learning, developing, and scaling apps with different technologies specifically machine learning my current highlight. Focusing on results, absorbing as much knowledge as possible, and working at different startups help me accomplish this.

I've had a passion for software engineering ever since I was a child, I wrote my first line of code (HTML lmao) when I was only 11 years old. I came a long way since then! Co-Founded my startup at 19, joined another one at 20 where I am currently working part-time. My computer science studies also help me practice my passion inside and outside the university. I focus a lot on extracurricular activities, thus being a GDSC lead and a member at Secruinets ISI.

I enjoy meeting new people, hearing different opinions, and learning new things. I also love sharing what I know. I believe that progress can only be achieved by sharing knowledge, so I take the lead! I should mention that I'm a huge F1 fan, with a side passion for Salsa, guitar, and the piano.
