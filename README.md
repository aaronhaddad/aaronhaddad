# Yoo! I am Aaron <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Readme-Workflows/Readme-Icons@main/icons/gifs/wave.gif" alt="Aaron says hi!" width="20" height="20" />

Remember that kid who turned the classroom into a tech lab? Das bin ich! Now transforming wild ideas into groundbreaking projects as a software engineer at [@root-global](https://github.com/root-global). From winning Google's innovation prize at Orange Summer Challenge 2022 to teaching Python at Gomycode and co-founding a tech startup at 20 years old, I'm all about pushing boundaries, creating innovative solutions, and sharing knowledge.

I'm a believer in going the extra mile – not just because it's the right thing to do, but also because it's where the magic happens. As a creative problem solver, I'm never satisfied with the status quo. I'm always looking to push the envelope, find new solutions to the hardest problems, and make the world a better place – one line of code at a time.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me cheering for a Formula One race, dancing bachata or probably learning about how quantum computing works, exploring the mysteries of the universe, or diving into the latest tech advancements.
